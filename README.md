Geospatial data for Operation Siren maps.


# About #
This repository contains the files I used to create my Operation Siren map. The main dataset is digitised versions of the Operation Siren zones in shapefile and geopackage formats, based on the work of [Scipio90001](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scipio90001 "Scipio90001") on reddit.
